            <h4>Car in Gastown</h4>
            <p>This car was in exhibition in Gastown. There was nothing saying why it was there or anything, 
                but it sure attracked a lot of tourists. This is one of the perks of living in Gastown, there 
                is always something going on.

            <p>This is our First Canada Day in Vancouver. It celebrates the anniversary, which united
                the three separate colonies of the Povince of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single 
                Dominion within the British Empire called Canada.  </p>

            <p>Another beautiful building in Gastown. It has a quite different shape and it attracks a lot of tourists.

            <h4>Gastown Steam Clock</h4>
            <p>The Steam Clock was built in 1977 by Raymond Saunders and Doug Smith. The clock was built as 
                a monumnet and placed over a steam grate. Every quarter hour, the Steam Clock whistles and 
                shoots steam from its five whistles.

            <p>I live in the red building right next to the Fire House in Gastown. 
                You can hear the sirens all day long. The firefighters are very nice 
                and always say good morning when I go to College.

            <h4>Fire Hall No 1! </h4>
            <p>This is the first Fire Hall in Vancouver and possibly the first 
                Fire Hall in North America. It is no longer used as a Fire Hall, 
                it was converted into the Fire Hall Arts Center in the 1970s.

            <h4>Missy's First Bath! </h4>
            <p>This is Missy's first bath in Canada! She didn't really like the 
                bath as she is used to showers. But we are in a new country and this 
                is our house now, so she really needs to get used to it.

            <h4>Vancouver War Memorial</h4>
            <p> The Victory Square Cenotaph was unveiled on 27 April 1924. 
                The site of the Cenotaph is significant because it was at tables at the foot of the 
                old courthouse steps where men signed up for the World War I. 
                The courthouse was demolished.</p>

                began on July 16, 1899 and it opened on December 8, 1900. It is listed on the Vancouver Heritage

            <p>This is a huge Christmas tree! Although many of you might think that
                this tree is in Itu, it is actually on Robson Square in Vancouver,
